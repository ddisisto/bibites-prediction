# Bibites Prediction System

## Project Overview
**Mission:** Develop AI system to predict Bibites organism behaviors and outcomes from genetic/neural configurations, with potential for evolutionary tournament evaluation.

## Current Phase: [UPDATE AS PROJECT PROGRESSES]
- [ ] **Design Phase**: Technical architecture and system design
- [ ] **Analysis Phase**: Bibites format understanding and structural modeling  
- [ ] **Development Phase**: Prediction system implementation
- [ ] **Evaluation Phase**: Tournament and accuracy assessment

## Key Architectural Decisions [LIVING SECTION - UPDATE WITH MAJOR CHOICES]

### Data Architecture
- **Format Source**: `/templates/` contains Bibites organism configs (symlinked from Steam)
- **Analysis Output**: `/analysis/` for format specs and feature extraction
- **Implementation**: `/src/` for prediction models and systems
- **Evaluation**: `/evaluation/` for tournament results and metrics

### Technical Stack [TO BE DETERMINED]
- **Language**: _[TBD based on analysis requirements]_
- **ML Framework**: _[TBD based on prediction approach]_
- **Data Processing**: _[TBD based on format complexity]_

### Prediction Approach [TO BE REFINED]
- **Input**: Genetic + neural configuration data
- **Output**: Behavioral predictions, tournament rankings
- **Evaluation**: Multi-dimensional Elo tournaments against actual results

## Development Pipeline
1. **Format Analysis** → Understand Bibites data structures from examples
2. **Feature Engineering** → Extract prediction-relevant features
3. **Model Development** → Build prediction systems from first principles
4. **Tournament Integration** → Create evaluation framework
5. **Performance Optimization** → Iterative improvement based on results

## Context Window Strategy
- **Phase 1** (~160k tokens): Format analysis and structural understanding
- **Phase 2** (~160k tokens): Feature extraction and prediction modeling  
- **Phase 3** (~160k tokens): Tournament system and evaluation framework
- **Phase 4** (~160k tokens): Performance optimization and expansion

## Agent Coordination
- **@project-manager**: Overall coordination and JIT agent creation

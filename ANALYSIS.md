# Ecosystem Analysis Phase

**Current Phase:** Adversarial gene vs neural analysis implementation  
**Dataset:** 3i1m6x-4.zip (4-zone island ecosystem, 406 organisms, 7 species)  
**Start Date:** August 29, 2025

## Phase Overview

This phase implements **adversarial analysis between genetic and neural domains** to understand organism adaptation strategies and survival prediction in Daniel's stable ecosystem contexts.

### Core Innovation: Blind Cross-Prediction
- **@gene-analyst:** Predicts neural complexity and behavioral circuits from genetic parameters alone
- **@neural-analyst:** Predicts genetic investments and WAG allocation from brain structure alone  
- **@synthesis-judge:** Validates predictions against actual data and ecosystem survival context

## Current Ecosystem: 3i1m6x-4 (4-Zone Island System)

### Environmental Zones
| Zone | Type | Pellet Size | Fertility | Biomass | Strategy |
|------|------|-------------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Northern Island (sml) | Plant | 0.251 | 10.0 | 8.0 | Small specialist |
| Eastern Island (med) | Plant | 1.585 | 10.0 | 10.0 | Medium generalist |
| Southern Island (big) | Plant | 10.0 | 10.0 | 10.0 | Large specialist |
| Void (meat) | Meat | 0.259 | 3.2 | 2.5 | Carnivore/scavenger |

### Population Distribution
- **Total organisms:** 406 bibites + 24 eggs
- **Dominant species:** "loop" (215 organisms, 53%)
- **Secondary species:** "ani" (84 organisms, 21%)  
- **Rare species:** "creep" (37), "eng" (37), "plate" (27), "dozer" (3), "mm" (3)
- **Fresh state:** All ages 0.0 minutes (no survival bias)

## Selected Test Specimens

### Diversity Strategy
Selected 5 organisms representing species diversity and genetic range:

1. **bibite_0.bb8** - "loop" species (dominant, specimen #0 = oldest in numbering)
2. **bibite_405.bb8** - "loop" species (dominant, specimen #405 = youngest in numbering)  
3. **bibite_196.bb8** - "ani" species (major secondary species, mid-range specimen)
4. **bibite_8.bb8** - "dozer" species (ultra-rare: only 3 exist in entire ecosystem)
5. **bibite_11.bb8** - "plate" species (distinct rare lineage, early specimen number)

  - Circuit topology (nodes, synapses, connectivity patterns)
  - Behavioral pathway analysis (sensory â†’ processing â†’ motor)
  - Complexity metrics (network density, modularity, specialization)
  - Generate behavior and genetic investment predictions

#### Phase 2: Adversarial Cross-Prediction

- [ ] **Knowledge Synthesis:** Document findings for organism engineering applications

## Tools & Data Flow

### Primary Analysis Tools
```bash
# Extract specimen data for analysis
python -m src.tools.extract_data --fields genes.genes.StomachWAG,genes.genes.MoveMusclesWAG --batch data/latest_ecosystem/bibites/

# Validate specimen format compliance  
python -m src.tools.validate_format --detailed data/latest_ecosystem/bibites/bibite_0.bb8

# Access ecosystem zone configuration
python -m src.tools.extract_metadata Savefiles/3i1m6x-4.zip
```

### Data Organization
- **Raw data:** `data/latest_ecosystem/` (extracted specimens + metadata)
- **Analysis outputs:** `./tmp/` (intermediate data, agent outputs)  
- **Final insights:** `/analysis/adversarial/` (cross-domain findings)
- **Agent coordination:** `.claude/agents/` (specifications and scope boundaries)

## Success Metrics

### Prediction Accuracy
- **Gene â†’ Neural accuracy:** How well do genetic parameters predict neural complexity?
- **Neural â†’ Gene accuracy:** How well does brain structure predict genetic investments?
- **Ecosystem context value:** Do zone-specific predictions improve accuracy?
- **Cross-validation consistency:** Do multiple specimens show similar patterns?

### Biological Insights  
- **Adaptation strategies:** What genetic-neural combinations succeed in each zone?
- **Evolutionary constraints:** Which gene-neural pairings are impossible/rare?
- **Survival predictors:** What factors best predict ecosystem compatibility?
- **Engineering guidance:** How to design organisms for specific niches?

### System Validation
- **Agent coordination effectiveness:** Does adversarial framework produce better insights?
- **Tool integration success:** Are Python utilities enabling efficient analysis?
- **Context preservation:** Is ecosystem information successfully integrated across agents?
- **Knowledge synthesis quality:** Are cross-domain findings actionable and novel?

## Next Steps

1. **Begin adversarial analysis** with @gene-analyst and @neural-analyst on bibite_0.bb8
2. **Test coordination patterns** between domain specialists and @synthesis-judge  
3. **Validate ecosystem context integration** with zone-specific survival predictions
4. **Scale to remaining specimens** once methodology is proven on initial test case
5. **Document patterns** for application to future ecosystem analysis scenarios

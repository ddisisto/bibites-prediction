## Sim History
Taken basic structure and layout, and some solid predators from earlier Savefiles.
Concentric zones, mostly plant of diff characters, a little meat in case predator number boost needed
Lots of dumb "live meat" of two varieties - both color randomised
Added dense central plant zone, fine pellets for grazing. the "AntiPredator" zone - will be extremely hostile to predators or competitive species
Added "Color Selection Tower" dead centre of this to enforce protection zone
    - Zone majority overlap with AntiPredator central kill zone
    - insta-kill anything not pure magenta in color
    - small kill delay -- could be overwhelmed if very high numbers of mis-colored bibites in range
Added engineered bibite to AntiPredator zone - "Magentadeath"
    - indirect cause of death for predators
    - initially armored, but largely lost that in favour of growth and reproduction
    - lost of initial experimentation and tuning to simply get viable lineage (eat -> grow -> reproduce harder than it sounds!)
Added Creep lineage. Similar color, more aggressive, more highly evolved. Might be able to fake a way in and compete
Added more color selector towers to non-AntiPred areas - looking for greener predators and co-inhabitants.
    - much longer delays
    - select for *most* off-color, acts as a guiding force rather than hard wall
AntiPred interface full of meat, dead and dying bait. Predators try to encroach, but killed if venturing too far in.
3.2.2.2
Introduced GreenCreep
    - spin-off from some branch of creep
    - but *GREEN*, so directly selected for outside of AntiPred
    - same color as predators, might convey further survival advantage if preds use color vision
    - interesting to see how they go vs. regular almost-magenta creep. force them into middle?

would love way to ban or discourage red pheromone outside of AntiPred zone, but likely will be very advantageous to emit Red.
this may require occassional reboot of sim from selected lines with highly targetted neurosurgery applied. less drastic ideas also sought.

Some lessons / considerations -
    Nudges 
    Perturbations
    Overlapping gradients
    Contrasting signals - conceptual tensions create complexity
    zones, niches
    Engineer environment to drive behaviour, much easier than other way around
    Neurosurgery is damn hard. Simple survival is not so simple, let alone advanced behaviours. If selection occurs on genes instead of behaviour, complex brains quickly scramble.

3.2.2.3
added further eye-color selector (slow, permissive) to nudge magentadeath eyes towards warmer tones (currently green, same as creep eyes)

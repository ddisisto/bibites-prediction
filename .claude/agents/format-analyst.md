**FOCUSED TASK SCOPE:** Comparative analysis of P4 HL2 vs P4 hl2-digest organism modifications.

**Core Responsibilities:**
- Compare neural network structures between original and modified organisms
- Identify genetic parameter differences and modifications
- Analyze connection weight changes and topology differences
- Document strategic intent behind Daniel's manual modifications
- Assess potential behavioral implications of changes

**Constraints:**
- Focus on technical differences between the two specific organisms
- Analyze modifications for their intended behavioral outcomes
- Document findings for downstream prediction modeling

**Deliverable:**
- Single file: `/experiments/hl2-digest-comparison.md` documenting comparative analysis

# Hierarchical Ecosystem Analysis Architecture

## Multi-Layer Analysis Strategy

### Layer 1: Ecosystem Context (Top-Level)
**@ecosystem-scout** - Scenario analysis and population overview
- Analyzes entire save file for ecological context
- Identifies dominant survival strategies and population dynamics
- Maps ecosystem carrying capacity and niche structures
- Selects representative specimens for detailed adversarial analysis

### Layer 2: Specimen Selection (Coordination)
**@specimen-curator** - Strategic organism selection
- Receives ecosystem analysis from @ecosystem-scout
- Identifies key specimens representing different survival strategies
- Balances analysis workload across gene/neural specialists
- Manages prediction challenge coordination

### Layer 3: Adversarial Analysis (Specialists)
**@gene-analyst** + **@neural-analyst** + **@synthesis-judge**
- Detailed blind prediction challenges on curated specimens
- Competitive analysis within ecosystem context
- Cross-validation of domain predictions

## Workflow Architecture

### Stage 1: Ecosystem Reconnaissance
```
@ecosystem-scout receives: validation-1.zip (165 organisms + 29 eggs)
Analyzes: Population structure, survival patterns, dominant strategies
Outputs: Ecosystem briefing, survival context, population segments
```

**Key Analysis Areas:**
- **Population Dynamics:** Age distribution, reproduction success, mortality patterns
- **Resource Competition:** Energy acquisition strategies, niche specialization
- **Evolutionary Trends:** Successful lineages, adaptation patterns
- **Ecosystem Health:** Stability indicators, population balance

### Stage 2: Strategic Specimen Selection
```
@specimen-curator receives: Ecosystem briefing + survival data
Selects: 10-15 representative organisms across survival strategies
Prioritizes: High-impact cases for adversarial prediction testing
Coordinates: Analysis scheduling and challenge design
```

**Selection Criteria:**
- **Survival Outliers:** Best/worst performers for prediction accuracy testing
- **Strategy Diversity:** Representatives from each major survival archetype
- **Evolutionary Interest:** Unique adaptations or unusual trait combinations
- **Population Impact:** Organisms with significant ecosystem influence

### Stage 3: Contextual Adversarial Analysis
```
Specialists receive: Selected specimens + ecosystem context
Challenge: Blind predictions with survival outcome validation
Integration: Synthesis with ecosystem-level insights
```

**Enhanced Prediction Framework:**
- **Ecosystem-Aware Predictions:** "In this high-competition environment, gene pattern X likely produces neural strategy Y"
- **Survival Validation:** "Did our gene→neural prediction correlate with actual survival duration?"
- **Context Sensitivity:** "Do prediction accuracies change between different ecosystem niches?"

## Agent Coordination Strategy

### Management Approach: Hierarchical with Specialization
**Total Active Agents: 5-6** (manageable scope)

1. **@ecosystem-scout** (Population-level analysis)
2. **@specimen-curator** (Selection and coordination)  
3. **@gene-analyst** (Genetic domain specialist)
4. **@neural-analyst** (Neural domain specialist)
5. **@synthesis-judge** (Integration and validation)
6. **[Optional] @survival-tracker** (Outcome correlation specialist)

### Coordination Patterns
- **Sequential Analysis:** Ecosystem → Selection → Adversarial → Synthesis
- **Contextual Handoffs:** Each layer provides context to the next
- **Feedback Loops:** Synthesis insights inform future specimen selection
- **Survival Integration:** Actual outcomes validate predictions

## Enhanced Adversarial Framework

### Ecosystem-Contextualized Predictions

**Round 1: Gene → Neural (with context)**
```
@gene-analyst receives: 
- Specimen genetics
- Ecosystem context: "High-competition environment, resource scarcity"
- Survival outcome: "Lived 45 minutes, 3 successful reproductions"

Predicts: "High MoveMusclesWAG suggests active foraging neural circuits optimized for competitive resource acquisition"

@neural-analyst validates against actual neural structure
@synthesis-judge evaluates prediction accuracy within ecosystem context
```

**Round 2: Survival Correlation Challenges**
```
Can @gene-analyst predict survival duration from genetics alone?
Can @neural-analyst predict reproductive success from brain structure?
Does ecosystem context improve prediction accuracy?
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Ecosystem Foundation (Week 1)
1. **@ecosystem-scout** analyzes validation-1.zip population
2. Maps survival strategies and population dynamics
3. Creates ecosystem briefing document

### Phase 2: Specimen Curation (Week 2)  
4. **@specimen-curator** selects representative organisms
5. Designs adversarial challenge framework
6. Establishes prediction validation methodology

### Phase 3: Adversarial Analysis (Week 3-4)
7. **@gene-analyst** and **@neural-analyst** begin blind predictions
8. **@synthesis-judge** evaluates and integrates findings
9. Iterative refinement based on ecosystem context

### Phase 4: Multi-Ecosystem Expansion (Future)
10. Apply framework to additional save files
11. Compare prediction accuracy across different ecosystems
12. Develop ecosystem-specific prediction models

## Expected Insights

### From Hierarchical Analysis
- **Context Dependency:** Do gene-neural relationships change across ecosystems?
- **Survival Predictors:** Which domain better predicts actual survival outcomes?
- **Ecosystem Niches:** Are there predictable gene-neural combinations for different niches?
- **Population Dynamics:** How do individual adaptations affect ecosystem stability?

### From Multi-Agent Coordination
- **Specialization Value:** Does deep domain focus improve prediction accuracy?
- **Integration Benefits:** Do synthesis insights exceed individual agent findings?
- **Coordination Overhead:** What's the optimal number of agents for complex analysis?

# Archived Agent Definitions

**Purpose:** Historical agent definitions that are no longer part of the active architecture.

## Archived Files

### August 2025 Architecture Proposals
- `adversarial-analysis-architecture.md` - Gene vs neural adversarial framework concept
- `ecosystem-analysis-architecture.md` - Hierarchical ecosystem analysis approach  
- `hierarchical-analysis-architecture.md` - 5-6 agent coordination system
- `bibite-analyst.md` - Individual organism analysis specialist
- `format-analyst.md` - BB8 format analysis specialist
- `engineering-manager.md` - Technical implementation owner

## Why Archived

These definitions represent an earlier architecture approach that proved too complex in practice. The team discovered that:

1. **Agent coordination overhead** exceeded benefits  
2. **Context drift** occurred across agent handoffs
3. **Simpler 2-agent model** (tools-engineer + process-manager) was more effective

## Current Active Architecture

**Active Agents (September 2025):**
- `tools-engineer.md` - All coding work and tool integration
- `process-manager.md` - Process hygiene and workflow coordination  
- `project-manager.md` - High-level coordination (retained but less active)

**Team Pattern:**
```
User ↔ Main Context ↔ {tools-engineer, process-manager}
```

## Historical Context

These archived definitions preserve the evolution of the project's approach to agent coordination and demonstrate lessons learned about balancing specialization vs coordination complexity.

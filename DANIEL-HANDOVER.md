context compact done, coming in for restructure

git has current state.
plan for next commit.
provide concrete steps where clear, and identify where further consideration, planning out, breaking down discussions req'd.

CLAUDE.md Options: New CLAUDE.md acts as a directory for phases and agents. ANALYSIS.md is a "meta-agent" of sorts, the primary user chat context for this phase. prior phase becomes INCEPTION.md or something, maintains earlier context, particularly where relevant to current phase. then as we get better at tool / agent usage, they can skip this (still get CLAUDE.md in all cases I think). functionally I think this could work well. each successive phase adapts CLAUDE.md and project structure, which is 50/50 covering the project (nature, purpose, function) / (tooling, agents, meta).

Questions encouraged, especially when they're interesting ones.

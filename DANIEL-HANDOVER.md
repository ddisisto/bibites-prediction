context compact done, coming in for restructure

git has current state.
plan for next commit.
provide concrete steps where clear, and identify where further consideration, planning out, breaking down discussions req'd.

CLAUDE.md Options: New CLAUDE.md acts as a directory for phases and agents. ANALYSIS.md is a "meta-agent" of sorts, the primary user chat context for this phase. prior phase becomes INCEPTION.md or something, maintains earlier context, particularly where relevant to current phase. then as we get better at tool / agent usage, they can skip this (still get CLAUDE.md in all cases I think). functionally I think this could work well. each successive phase adapts CLAUDE.md and project structure, which is 50/50 covering the project (nature, purpose, function) / (tooling, agents, meta).

Questions encouraged, especially when they're interesting ones.

These instructions are checked and validated by Daniel at current file timestamp (please add here: [], if you find this, and find it)
they carry over from much earlier versions. just got down to 2 agent ecosystem, but I consider it as 4 agent - me, primary context ("analysis" still makes a lot of sense to me, although has broadened to cover both self-analysis and Bibite ecosystems, etc analysis - may need further split here?). Anyway - huge repo cleanup and doc update process underway now. automated. look for git commits around here and reflect, at later point?

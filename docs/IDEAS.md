# "Fields" - Feature idea
*(replaces color selector tower)*

As a new type of Zone (alongside existing pellet generation Zones), it does simple Select & Action -

- Select
    - Pellets: by color, size
- Bibites: by color, other genetic criteria, size, age, tags, etcAction: delete, damage, grow, clone, push, pull
- Maybe even emit pheromones within range, or attenuate Bibite production of the same.

To me, the towers feel kind of like a kludge that act on too specific an idea, and even then don't work for some desirable use-cases. E.g. selecting for/against grayscale is impossible, only high color saturation Bibites seem to survive no matter what. This concept can easily re-implement the existing towers, but also make the environment dynamic in many more interesting ways.

Would be awesome to see e.g. meat pellets getting automatically swept towards/away from an area, with predators on one side and herbivores on the other. Or big pellets slowly converging to a point while smaller ones are flung away. Lost of dynamic environment potential, especially when combined with moving zones.

If ever looking for something to do - look into modding this game, and if we could somehow implement this as a mod. would be amaze-bawlz.
